#This repository is a demonstration on building fast and maintainable API tests using SuperTest, Mocha, and Chai. 

The examples in this repo are explained in detail in the Dev Tester blog.

#To run the tests, you first need an account at Airport Gap, an application built to help you improve your test automation skills. After signing up, you'll receive an API token to access the endpoints requiring authentication.
